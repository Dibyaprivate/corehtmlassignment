   <h1>Programming Quotes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for
            machines to execute.</li>
        <li>Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a
            comment, ask yourself, 'How can I improve the code so that this comment
            isn't needed?</li>
        <li>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers
            write code that humans can understand."</li>
        <li> Give a man a program, frustrate him for a day. Teach a man to program,
            frustrate him for a lifetime.</li>
        <li>It's not at all important to get it right the first time. It's vitally
            important to get it right the last time.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>

        <li>"The best error message is the one that never shows up." - Thomas Fuchs</li>
        <li>"In software, the most beautiful code, the most beautiful functions, and the most beautiful programs are sometimes not there at all." - Jon Bentley</li>
        <li>"The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it." - Dennis Ritchie</li>
        <li>"You might not think that programmers are artists, but programming is an extremely creative profession. It's logic-based creativity." - John Romero</li>
